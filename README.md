# MLimplementations


This will be a guide to implementing ML algorithms as can be used for the course CBDM at ITU. The models include:
1. Clustering (kMeans)
1. Classification (kNN)
1. Network analysis (iGraph)
1. Natural language processing (spaCy)

Additionally we look at how to use pandas to clean/preprocess data.
